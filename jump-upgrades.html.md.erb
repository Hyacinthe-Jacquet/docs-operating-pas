This topic describes upgrading to <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) v2.11 directly from
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.7 and later.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Jump upgrading describes the process of skipping minor versions when upgrading
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>. Jump upgrading enables you to upgrade directly to the
long-term support (LTS) version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, which is v2.11.
<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11 is supported through April 2024.


## <a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Before you jump upgrade to <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11:

1. Verify that the products you have installed are compatible with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.11. To create an upgrade path for your product tiles, see the [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

1. Upgrade <%= vars.ops_manager %> to v2.10 LTS. For more information, see [<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.10 Release Notes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/2-10/release-notes.html).
